            <h3>Hello world!</h3>
            <p>
                I am a software engineer who really enjoys all things computer science. I am not entirely sure what
                I want to do with this blog as of yet, but I hope to do technical writing about new things I am learning 
                or cool concepts that I want to give my take on. This could also just be a place for me to mess around with
                new ideas or something like that. Who knows. I hope you enjoy.
            </p>
